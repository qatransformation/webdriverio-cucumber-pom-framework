## 🎯 Main Test Case (Requirement)

The main scenario covers exactly the requested requirements:

```gherkin
Scenario: Add and manage complete tasks
  Given the user navigates to the TodoMVC application
  When the user adds the task "Buy milk"
  And the user adds the task "Exercise"
  Then the counter should show "2 items left"
  When the user marks task "Buy milk" as completed
  Then the counter should show "1 item left"
  When the user reloads the page
  Then the counter should show "1 item left"
  And the task "Buy milk" should be marked as completed
  When the user deletes all tasks
  Then the task list should be empty
```

✅ Meets all requirements:
1. ✓ Navigate to: https://demo.webdriverio.dev/todomvc/
2. ✓ Add two tasks
3. ✓ Mark one as completed
4. ✓ Validate the counter shows "1 item left"
5. ✓ Refresh the page and verify the state is preserved
6. ✓ Delete all tasks and validate the list is empty
