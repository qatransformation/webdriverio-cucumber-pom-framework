# Screenshot Placeholder

This is a placeholder image. Please replace with an actual screenshot following the instructions in `docs/screenshots/README.md`.

**Expected screenshot:** Delete confirmation dialog showing:
- Warning message
- List of items that will be deleted (HTML, videos, screenshots, logs)
- OK and Cancel buttons

To generate this screenshot:
1. Run: `npm run serve:report`
2. Click on any "🗑️ Delete" button
3. Capture screenshot of the confirmation dialog (DON'T click OK yet!)
4. Save as `delete-button-confirmation.png` in this folder
5. Click Cancel to avoid deleting the execution
